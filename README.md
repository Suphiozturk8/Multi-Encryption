# Python Code Encryption Tool

This Python script provides a basic code encryption functionality using a series of encoding techniques. It takes a Python file as input, encrypts the code with multiple layers of encoding, and saves the result in a new file.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**
    - Execute the script in a Python environment.
    - Enter the file path of the Python code you want to encrypt.
    - Choose the number of encoding layers.

2. **Output:**
    - The encrypted code is saved in a new file with the suffix `_encrypted.py`.

## Example

```python
python encryption_script.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How It Works

The script employs various encoding functions like base64, base32, base16, etc., to encrypt the Python code. The number of layers determines the complexity of the encryption.

## Note

This tool is for educational purposes only. Use it responsibly and respect the terms of service of the platforms where you share the encrypted code.
